## Game scenario
The main goal is reset some Sweddish factory :)

## Design / Tech. details
A 2D stealth action platformer with hand-crafted pixel-art animation. 
Made for the 2019 Games Programming Laboratory at ETH. A original game trailer can be seen on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0zmt9HId54).

## Controlling via TouchPanel
- Swipe left/right/up/down: move left/right/up/down
- Tap (screen): jump (or skip long mom-dauther dialogs)))
- Double swipe down: hide
- Double swipe left: back (?)
- Double swipe right: open the door
- Double swipe up: call mom ;)
- Three-finger multi-touch: pause / menu
